IoT Projects
====================

The Elite Explorer Kit utilizes the built-in ESP32-S3 WiFi and Bluetooth module on the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board, enabling a variety of easy and enjoyable IoT projects. The WiFi connectivity allows you to connect your Arduino to the internet and cloud platforms for IoT experiments. And Bluetooth provides short-range wireless communication capabilities.

With WiFi, you can build projects like a simple web server to control an LED remotely, interact with the Arduino IoT Cloud to monitor sensors, create security alerts with IFTTT using a PIR sensor, and make a cloud-based calling system using MQTT. We provide step-by-step guides to implement these and other networked IoT projects.

The Bluetooth functionality enables localized wireless projects such as exchanging messages on an LCD screen, monitoring temperature and humidity data from sensors on a smartphone app.
