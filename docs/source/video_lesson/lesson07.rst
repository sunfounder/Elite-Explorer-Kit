LESSON 7: Doing Math in Binary
================================

This lesson dives into the fascinating world of binary mathematics, specifically focusing on how binary calculations power everything from simple Arduino devices to complex supercomputers. Here's a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Binary Basics and Numbers**: Introduction to the concept of binary numbers, including how single bits represent binary digits (0 and 1), and how these bits combine to represent larger numbers.
2. **Understanding Binary Operations**: Explore basic binary operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through hands-on examples.
3. **Practical Application with a Binary Counter**: Through a detailed demonstration, you'll see how to apply binary calculations in programming an Arduino for tasks like counting and basic arithmetic.
4. **Extending Binary to Other Uses**: Understand how binary applies to a variety of digital representations including colors, pictures, movies, letters, words, books, music, and more.
5. **Homework Challenge**: Strengthen your understanding of binary mathematics with a practical exercise involving binary operations and real-world applications.
