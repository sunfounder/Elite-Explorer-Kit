LESSON 9: Using the Serial Port to Print to the Serial Monitor
================================================================

This lesson focuses on using the serial port to transmit data from the Arduino to the computer's screen, specifically through the serial monitor. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Introduction to Serial Communication**: Understanding the basics of serial communication between Arduino and your desktop computer.
2. **Setting up the Arduino Environment**: Configuring the Arduino IDE, selecting the correct board, port, and basic sketch setup to ensure everything is ready for serial communication.
3. **Developing a Simple Counting Program**: Writing a program that counts numbers and uses the serial port to display these numbers on the computer screen.
4. **Enhancing Program Functionality**: Incorporating various data types and string manipulations to format and present data effectively on the serial monitor.
5. **Homework Assignment**: Applying the concepts learned by modifying an LED blink program to include serial communication, reinforcing the lesson through practical application.
