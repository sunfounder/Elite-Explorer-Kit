LESSON 20: For Loops in Arduino
=================================
This lesson demonstrates how to create a user-controlled RGB LED system using the Arduino, where the user can specify the number of blinks through the serial monitor. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Reviewing Previous Homework**: Recapping the assignment from Lesson 19, which involved blinking an RGB LED in a red-green-blue sequence for 25 cycles.
2. **Setting Up the Circuit**: Detailed instructions on how to correctly connect an RGB LED and its current-limiting resistors to the Arduino. Each color channel (red, green, blue) is connected to a PWM digital pin (pins 9, 10, and 11), and the common cathode (long leg) is connected to ground.
3. **Writing the Code**: Step-by-step coding instructions to:Define the pins for each color channel of the RGB LED.Set up the serial monitor for user input.Use analog write commands to control the brightness of each color channel.Implement a for loop to control the number of blink cycles based on user input.Ensure the program stops after the specified number of blinks.
4. **Debugging Tips**: Guidance on troubleshooting common issues such as:Correcting syntax errors in the code.Ensuring the program loops the correct number of times.Handling user input correctly and stopping the program after the specified cycles.
5. **Practical Applications**: Examples of using for loops to repeat a sequence of actions a specified number of times. 
6. **Homework Assignment**: Repeating the blink sequence a user-specified number of times without using a for loop.Ensuring the program stops after the specified number of blinks.
