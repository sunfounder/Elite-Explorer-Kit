LESSON 11: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Simulation of Analog Voltages
=======================================================================

This lesson explores the fundamentals of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) as a method for simulating analog voltages using Arduino's digital pins. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Understanding PWM**: Delve into the basics of PWM and its role in simulating analog outputs from digital signals, essential for controlling devices like LEDs in variable intensities.
2. **Digital vs. Analog Signals**: Contrast the nature of digital outputs, which are either fully on or off, with the needs of applications requiring a range of outputs, and how PWM bridges this gap.
3. **Setting Up PWM on Arduino**: Learn the specific setup for PWM on Arduino, including selecting the correct pins (those marked with a squiggly line) and configuring them in the IDE.
4. **Practical PWM Application**: Implement a practical exercise to control an LED's brightness using PWM, illustrating the concept of varying voltage levels over time.
5. **Homework Assignment**: Enhance understanding by experimenting with different PWM values to vary an LED's brightness, reinforcing the practical applications of PWM learned in the lesson.
