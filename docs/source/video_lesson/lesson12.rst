LESSON 12: Read Analog Voltages on the Arduino
================================================

This lesson explores how to read analog voltages using the Arduino, expanding upon previous lessons on digital and analog outputs. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Introduction to Analog Reading**: Understand the basic principles of reading analog voltages with the Arduino, emphasizing the importance of not exceeding the 5-volt input limit to avoid damage.
2. **Using a Potentiometer**: Learn how to use a potentiometer to create a variable voltage source that can be read by the Arduino, demonstrating the setup through a practical circuit-building exercise.
3. **Practical Application and Circuit Building**: Follow step-by-step instructions to build a circuit that includes a potentiometer and how to connect it to the Arduino for reading voltage variations.
4. **Coding for Analog Reading**: Dive into the code required to read and interpret analog voltages, including setting up the Arduino sketch to display these voltages.
5. **Homework Assignment**: Solidify your learning by adjusting the potentiometer to change the LED brightness linked to the voltage read by the Arduino, reinforcing the concepts of analog input and output.
