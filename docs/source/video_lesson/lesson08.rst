LESSON 8: Using Variables in Arduino
======================================

This lesson introduces the concept of using variables in Arduino programming, enhancing flexibility and maintainability of code. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Setup and Introduction**: Setting up the necessary components for an Arduino project using the SunFounder kit, preparing for a practical programming session.
2. **Understanding Variables**: Learning why and how to use variables in Arduino programs to replace hard-coded numbers, which enhances code flexibility and maintainability.
3. **Practical Example with LED and Morse Code**: Implementing a Morse code SOS signal using variables to control the LED states and timings, showing practical application of variables.
4. **Improving Code with Variables**: Demonstrating how to improve and simplify program modifications by using variables instead of fixed values, which saves time and reduces errors in larger programs.
5. **Homework Assignment**: Applying the concepts learned to create a circuit with two LEDs (red and green), where the green LED blinks quickly five times and the red LED blinks slowly ten times, reinforcing the use of variables in controlling different aspects of a program.
