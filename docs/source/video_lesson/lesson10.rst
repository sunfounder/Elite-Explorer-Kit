LESSON 10: Writing Analog Voltages With the Arduino
=====================================================

This lesson teaches how to control the brightness of an LED by writing analog voltages using the Arduino. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Introduction to Analog Output**: Understand the basics of analog outputs compared to digital, learning why and how they allow for varying levels of power output rather than just on/off states.
2. **Setting up the Arduino**: Review how to set up the Arduino IDE and configure the board for analog output, specifically focusing on using PWM pins.
3. **Building the Circuit**: Instructions on constructing a circuit with an LED and resistor, emphasizing the importance of connecting to PWM-capable pins for analog functionality.
4. **Programming for Variable Brightness**: Writing code to adjust the LED's brightness using the `analogWrite()` function, demonstrating the effect of different values on LED brightness.
5. **Homework Assignment**: Develop a program that incrementally changes the LED's brightness from dimmest to brightest and then back to dimmest, reinforcing the lesson's concepts through a dynamic display.
