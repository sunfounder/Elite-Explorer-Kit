LESSON 6: Create a Binary Counter With Arduino
================================================

This lesson guides you through the intriguing process of building a binary counter using an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and the Sunfounder Elite Explorer Kit. Here's a succinct summary of what you'll learn:

1. **Setup and Tools Introduction**: Starting with the essentials, the lesson introduces the tools and setup required for the project, including the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and components from the Sunfounder Elite Explorer Kit.
2. **Review of Basics**: It revisits fundamental concepts like turning LEDs on and off, using resistors, and setting up pin modes on the Arduino.
3. **Binary Counting**: The core of the lesson, where you'll learn to program the Arduino to count in binary using LEDs, making the abstract concept of binary numbers tangible.
4. **Code Implementation**: Detailed walkthrough on writing and implementing the Arduino code to control the LEDs and make them count in binary from 0 to 15.
5. **Homework Challenge**: The lesson concludes with a homework assignment challenging you to expand the binary counter by adding another LED, enabling the system to count up to 31 in binary.
