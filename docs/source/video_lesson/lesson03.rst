LESSON 3: Blink an LED With the Arduino
=========================================

This lesson is part of a tutorial series designed to help learners think like engineers by using the Arduino R4 WiFi board. In this session, Paul Mcarter walks through building and programming a simple LED circuit to blink in an SOS pattern using the Arduino. The lesson covers a practical application of earlier tutorials and introduces basic electronic concepts such as using a breadboard, managing circuit schematics, and programming the Arduino to manipulate hardware outputs. Here's what you will learn:

1. **Review of Homework**: The instructor reviews a homework assignment which involved blinking an LED using Arduino, building on concepts taught in earlier lessons.
2. **Circuit Building**: Detailed guidance on constructing a circuit with an LED and resistor on a breadboard, including how to connect these components to the Arduino board correctly.
3. **Programming the Arduino**: Step-by-step coding instructions in the Arduino IDE to control the LED. This includes writing digital outputs, and implementing the ``pinMode`` and ``digitalWrite`` functions.
4. **Debugging Tips**: Practical advice on debugging common errors in code, such as typos or incorrect pin setups, and emphasizes the importance of checking your work and understanding error messages.
5. **Homework Assignment**: For further practice, learners are tasked to create a circuit with four LEDs that blink simultaneously, each requiring separate control through the Arduino.
