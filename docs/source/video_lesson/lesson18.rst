LESSON 18: Controlling RGB LED with an Arduino
================================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
This lesson demonstrates how to use an RGB LED with an Arduino to create different colors by combining red, green, and blue light, building on previous lessons about controlling LEDs and using the Arduino's PWM capabilities. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you will learn:

1. **Reviewing Previous Homework**:Recapping the assignment from Lesson 17, which involved creating a circuit with three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) and controlling them based on user input.
2. **Setting Up the Circuit**:Detailed instructions on how to correctly connect an RGB LED to the Arduino. The RGB LED has four legs: one common ground and three for the red, green, and blue LEDs. Each color channel requires a separate current-limiting resistor to prevent crosstalk and ensure proper operation.
3. **Writing the Code**:Step-by-step coding instructions to:Define the pins for each color channel of the RGB LED.Set up the serial monitor for user input.Use digital write commands to turn on and off each color channel.Convert user input to lowercase to handle different cases.
4. **Practical Applications**:Examples of controlling the RGB LED to produce various colors by turning on different combinations of the red, green, and blue LEDs. 
5. **Homework Assignment**:Extending the project by asking the user for specific colors, including red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, orange, and white.
