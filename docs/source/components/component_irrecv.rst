.. An infrared-receiver is a component which receives infrared signals and can independently receive infrared rays and output signals compatible with TTL level. It is similar with a normal plastic-packaged transistor in size and is suitable for all kinds of infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

SL838 is a small receiver for infrared remote control systems. It contains high speed and high sensitivity photodiode and preamplifier, and is packaged with epoxy resin to form infrared filter, Its main advantage is that it hasreliable function even in the disturbed environment.

Infrared, or IR, communication is a popular, low-cost, easy-to-use wireless communication technology. Infrared light has a slightly longer wavelength than visible light, so it is imperceptible to the human eye - ideal for wireless communication. A common modulation scheme for infrared communication is 38KHz modulation.

* Can be used for remote control
* Wide operating voltage: 2.7~5V
* Internal filter for PCM frequency 
* TTL and CMOS compatibility
* Strong anti-interference ability
* Compliant RoHS
