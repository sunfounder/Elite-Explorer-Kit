================

    :width: 40%

This pump essentially functions as a DC motor, operating at a voltage of 3V and a current of 100mA. Upon powering, the pump draws water in from the bottom of its plastic casing and expels it from the outlet pipe. It must always be kept immersed in water to function properly. Reversing the polarity won't turn it into a water intake device; it will only pump water out!

It's highly suitable for beginners to create a fountain or plant watering project using this submersible pump, as it is incredibly user-friendly!
